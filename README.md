# Vibration Data of a Bolted Joint Structure

The experimental test rig is nonlinearly dependent on excitation amplitude, presenting the well-known softening effect of friction joints. The structure presents data variation related to the presence of uncertainties in the measurement process. The experimental measurements were conducted through different days and only the tightening torque in the joint connection was controlled after each experimental realization.

Figure above presents the jointed structure investigated. The test rig is formed of two aluminum beams, each one with dimensions of 270 mm x 25.4 mm x 6.35 mm and assembled by a bolted-joint connection with a tightening torque of 5 Nm. The excitation of the structure was conducted by a Modal Shop 2400E shaker located at 85 mm from the clamped end of the cantilever beam to minimize shaker/structure interaction. Due to observability purposes for modeling the first vibration mode of the structure, the system output was measured at the free end of the beam, using a laser vibrometer Polytec OFV-525/5000S.
