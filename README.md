# Description

The experimental test rig is nonlinearly dependent on excitation amplitude, presenting the friction joints' well-known softening effect. The structure presents data variation related to the presence of uncertainties in the measurement process. The experimental measurements were conducted through different days, and only the tightening torque in the joint connection was controlled after each experimental realization.

The figure above presents the joint structure investigated. The test rig comprises two aluminum beams, each with dimensions of 270 mm x 25.4 mm x 6.35 mm, and assembled by a bolted-joint connection with a tightening torque of 5 Nm. The structure's excitation was conducted by a Modal Shop 2400E shaker located at 85 mm from the clamped end of the cantilever beam to minimize shaker/structure interaction. Due to observability purposes for modeling the structure's first vibration mode, the system output was measured at the free end of the beam, using a laser vibrometer Polytec OFV-525/5000S. The schematic top view of the experimental setup is shown below.

The data acquisition system was the LMS SCADAS. The structure was excited using different levels of input amplitude 0.05 V (low), 0.10 V (medium) and
0.20 V (high). This paper regards the voltage supplied by the shaker amplifier  as the excitation signal since it is easier to keep this signal constant over a frequency range. All signals were measured with a sampling frequency of 1024 Hz.
